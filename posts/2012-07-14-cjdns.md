### cjdns
cjdns is a routing engine designed for security, scalability, speed and ease of use. The dream: [...] give it an interface which connects another node and it gives you an ipv6 address generated from a [public encryption key] and a virtual network card (TUN device) which you can use to send packets to anyone in the cjdns network to which you are connected.

There is a great introductory video at [projectmeshnet.org] and a more detailed interview with the author by slashRoot is available on [Youtube]. A [RFC-stile overview] can be found in the [projects github repo].

I am usually [revolutionary] towards ambitious projects, but this seems very real. Routing itself is visibly fast, and the switching part could even by run on a GPU as noted in the interview. Encryption is enabled by default when a packet is to be routed be a third party and authenticated encryption is possible. I'd prefer even more aggressive defaults, but it's still way better than plaintext communication practiced today.

I will look into scalability after Ipho and am currently too uncertain to come up with any estimates, but it should perform way better than [OLSR] or [B.A.T.M.A.N.] and does not suffer from (theoretical) excessive routing table updates after network changes for address-space balancing like [netsukuku] or my homegrown design. They say it [scales well](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/issues/104) though ;).
