-- IPhO 2012 ''[Program for student]''

In  addition to that, all competitors had to pass an airport-like security check
before entering the contest hall.

I was there. The ''security'', originally meant to protect the academic integrity
of results, was, of course, useless and also not surprisingly a pain in the ass.
Sadly, IPhO 2012 is just an example, the attitude ranted about in this post is far
more common.

To let competitors solve tasks in
their native language, the leaders were to translate them the night before the
examination.
Each group of four students from the same country was appointed a guide who was
supposed to look after them, keep them in line of sight at all times and make
sure they do not communicate with anybody else.
Students were separated from team leaders and observers during the second day and
accomodated in a different city. The reasoning behind this is to avoid teachers
tipping off students about the tasks to come. To the same and, all electronics,
even those clearly useless for communicating, were to be confiscated.

This rendered all students
dependent on their guides and the organizers in general -- in a foreign
country without any means to reach their peers.
In addition to the obvious discomforts caused to competitors, it amplified
several vacancies in the actions of the organizers. There were cases when people
went out to jog, smoke, or just to take walk and were looked for by numerous
guides thinking how lost one might be. There were legitimate and urgent topics
to be discussed between students and their teachers.
More than a hundred people spent a night worrying about problems
created by other regulations that could have been significantly mitigated by
clear communication, possibly with their own teachers.

And what did we actually get out of it? Students were *asked* to give their
electronics away, anyone could have kept a cellphone just by saying that they
don't have one with them. __If one had decided to cheat before the
electronics were confiscated, that would have been easy__. In addition to that,
some students /did/ talk on the phone to the teachers during the guarantine. In their
native language. There was a guide present (the owner of the phone) but the
chance of him understanding anything at all of the conversation was negilible.
And if inventing an excuse to get to use a guide's phone would have sounded too
difficult, one could just have walked to the shopping centre across the road and
asked people for directions to the nearest internet access point. __Contacting
the leaders was made less convenient, but not less possible__. If one would have
wanted to ask their leader about the tasks, it would have been possible with
relatively small effort. Confiscating electronics is useless.

Security checks before entering the examination hall were less disturbing but
even easier to prove useless. I did not manage to confirm it first-hand, but the
rumor says that one of the organizers themselves took on the security check on
his own and
sneaked in with an axe, two cellphones and Suspicious Pieces Of Paper. Even if
it did not actually happen, there was nothing that could have prevented it.
__The only thing keeping students from cheating was their own honesty__.

The experimental examination took part in two groups, because there was not
enough equipment for all students at once. While the first group was taking the
exam, the second group was confined in a science adventure park. People slept on
chairs and floors, studied for the competition and someone even managed to get
her hands on some dry ice to play tricks with. Wouldn't it have been saner and
easier to confine those who know the tasks (because they are solving them and
therefore already in one room with a good reason to be there) and let those who
don't know have their way?

If somebody wants to cheat, they can. Preventing it may not be impossible, but
it most likely isn't worth it. Just stacking up random ''security'' measures only
makes everything more complicated, especially for the honest. It should not come
as a surprise that people do not like being restrained from communicating with
the outside world or having their possessions taken away, even temporarily.
