As you're looking at it right now, you have probably already figured out that I started a blog. Yes, another one. Anything that needs to be has not been said out, and probably never will be. This is the ''how''.

The requirments for the blogging platform were roughly the following:

* Ability to add equations, code, javascript and own HTML in general. This rules out [Blogger] and free hosted [Wordpress].
* Easy to use: I want to write my posts in [Vim] and use a markup language for that. I want to put my posts and templates under [version control]. I want to see the exact result before publishing it.
* Free as in beer. There are some free dynamic hosting providers, but I've never heard of throughly positive experiences with them. Therefore, my blog will be static.
* Understandable - no thousands of lines of magical, fragile code.

After looking at several static site generators, I picked [Hakyll]. The choice was almost arbitrary and based on more intuition than research. Previous good experiences with similar configuration system (full-featured [Haskell] code) used by [Xmonad] (a great window manager) probably broke the tie.

The current configuration is a mix of [Hakyll]-powered pages I liked, including [coldflake], [wunki], [wuzzweb] and Hakyll examples. The header font is [Exo] from [Google Web Fonts], equations are rendered using [MathJax].  The comments are powered by [Disqus]. Thanks to all who made it work. 

As a note to anyone who is planning to use [Hakyll] with [Github Pages], you probably want two separate repositories: one for the source code and other for the `_site` directory.

$$\gamma =  \frac{1}{ \sqrt{1 - { \beta^2}}}$$  where  $$\beta = v/c$$
